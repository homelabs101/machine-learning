1. Recommending items based on global popularity can (check all that apply):
none of the above

2. Recommending items using a classification approach can (check all that apply):
provide personalization
capture context (e.g., time of day)

3. Recommending items using a simple count based co-occurrence matrix can (check all that apply):
provide personalization

4. Recommending items using featurized matrix factorization can (check all that apply):
provide personalization
capture context (e.g., time of day)

5. Normalizing co-occurrence matrices is used primarily to account for:

6. A store has 3 customers and 3 products. Below are the learned feature vectors for each user and product. Based on this estimated model, which product would you recommend most highly to User #2?
Product #2

7. For the liked and recommended items displayed below, calculate the recall and round to 2 decimal points. (As in the lesson, green squares indicate recommended items, magenta squares are liked items. Items not recommended are grayed out for clarity.) Note: enter your answer in American decimal format (e.g. enter 0.98, not 0,98)
0.33

8. For the liked and recommended items displayed below, calculate the precision and round to 2 decimal points.
